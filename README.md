# Before You Interact

Check out my lovemail: https://github.com/TSUKIMI-SHIN/Puppet-Of-Fate

Hello! You may know me as Snicket or any kin names (check out the rentry for it!) This BYI isn't too important, it's just letting you know about the worst of me.

You may hear about me through all sorts of people! Feel free to approach me to gain your own perspective on me! I am quite busy nowadays though, so I may not stick around for long if I am friendly. I tend to have a lot of mental issues, so I may hallucinate certain things or get paranoid. Karua Tip: Avoid abandoning me if I need you!
I watermark my ponies by making their necks invisible! I permahide + block other people who use it for my comfort. I need to be able to set myself apart! (Not counting characters that already use it such as Ena!)

I'm currently a minor, but often forget my age and will see myself as similar to the ages of people I hang out with. Please forgive me!
Also don't aggressively act romantic or sexual towards me just because any of us kin, introject, or remind you of certain characters. It's a bit weird..
Usually if you have a DNI that is meant to distance me, but you interact with me anyways, I will likely consider the DNI invalidated/voided due to your own actions. I will probably ignore you anyways, but I do not tolerate hypocricy.

I think that's all for now.. I suffer on the daily with a lot of issues, so I may have to add or change more in the future. Byebye, Eight!
P.S. I love Strawpage and Atabook signs! Feel free to sign them ^_^ just be nice!
