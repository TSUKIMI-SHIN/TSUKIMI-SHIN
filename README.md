# Before You Interact

Check out my lovemail: https://github.com/TSUKIMI-SHIN/Puppet-Of-Fate

Hello! You may know me as Snicket or any kin names (check out the rentry for it!) This BYI isn't too important, it's just letting you know about the worst of me.

You may have have heard of me through friends or ex-friends alike! I'm considered an experience that's hard to let go, but I don't recommend getting attatched to me.

I watermark my ponies by making their necks invisible! I permahide + block other people who use it for my comfort. I need to be able to set myself apart! (Not counting characters that already use it such as Ena!)

In some cases, I still can't hide or block people as they may continue to harass and attack me if I do. In fact, they may be reading this very post right now! Hii! Kind of my guess though.. I'm not into that stalking stuff but it's a common habit of my former friends. I deal with paranoia and other mental issues too so they may affect me during our time together.

Another thing to add- if you do not want me to interact, than don't approach me, or I will consider the DNI voided since you broke it yourself COUGHH TRANSPHOBES (I'm trans). (Unless it's a DNIUID thing)

Note: I'm currently still a minor, and tend to prefer talking to people my age or older! I'm kind of wary around younger people since they've had a habit of targeting me since I was a wee little kid. I do not go on the 18+ server either.

I think that's all for now.. I suffer on the daily with a lot of issues, so I may have to add or change more in the future. Byebye, Eight!
P.S. I love Strawpage and Atabook signs!
